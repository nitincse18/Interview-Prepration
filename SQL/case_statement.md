SQL CASE Statement

Functionality of an IF-THEN-ELSE Statement.
Returns a value on a specific condition.
We can use case statement within a sql statement.
IFâ€¦.ELSE, where only the maximum of one condition is allowed, CASE allows the user to apply multiple conditions to perform different sets of actions.
We can use CASE in statements such as SELECT, UPDATE and SET, and in clauses such as select_list, IN, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING.

CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END


A simple CASE statement with a comparison operator:

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

              WHEN PersonType = 'IN' THEN 1
              ELSE 0
           END
